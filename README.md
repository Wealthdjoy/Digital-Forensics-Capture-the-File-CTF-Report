## Manual File Extraction from HTTP Traffic - PCAP

This forensic Capture The Flag (CTF) excercise was carried out by manual extraction of files transmitted via HTTP traffic in a captured network session (bns_captured_activity.pcap). Without using code or automation, tools like Wireshark and HxD Hex Editor were used to uncover hidden files embedded within HTTP packets.
